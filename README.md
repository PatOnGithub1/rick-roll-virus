# rick-roll-virus
!NOTE!
this virus doesnt actually spread. I guess its not a virus then.
All it does is it runs a few commands in the terminal that opens ms edge and then opens rickroll links


If you are cautious about it, then feel free to check through the code
Also, you may change the links if you like, it shouldnt do anyhting.

Works on W10 and W11, anything below that i have no idea.

If you want it to spread, do it yourself. I considered adding a variant that spreads, but i don't want to get an email going around that rickrolls people
